# CourseraGCdataproject
Project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera

Four things were required as a part of the submission of this assignment--1) a tidy data set, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 4) You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 

The data being manipulated in this project are related to wearable computing and were collected using a Samsung Galaxy smartphone. The original files can be found at the following link:
